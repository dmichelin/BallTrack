Purpose: This provides a graphic simulation of distributed nodes coordinating
asynchronously to enter a critical section.

Usage: Compile and run the project or use the included JAR file. Use the
slider to determine how many nodes you want to have in your simulation, then
press start. The command line will show how the system communicates through
one another, and the screen will show graphically what is happening.
